## Description

This is a back end object relational mapper application. The purpose of which is to organize and sort different products. It uses MySQL database with Node.Js, Express, Sequelize, and dotenv.

## Installation 

In order to install this application, simply clone it the repo to your bash or terminal. You may also need to install a few packages if they don't already load. MySQL, Node.js, Express, and dotenv are required. You can install these in the terminal by typing 'npm i'. For individual package installation instructions, find it on npmjs.com.

## Usage

In order to use this first run mysql in your terminal. Add the schema. Then run npm seed/server.js in the terminal. Next go to Insomnia and make sure the port says 3002. I changed it specifically to 3002 in order to avoid problems with other applications that are on 3001. Once you are in Insomnia, go through all of them and hit send.
